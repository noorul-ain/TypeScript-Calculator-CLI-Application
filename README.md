TypeScript Calculator CLI Application
This repository contains a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator Application built with TypeScript and Inquirer.js. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) interactively. The application demonstrates the power of TypeScript in building strongly-typed, scalable, and robust applications.

Features
ðŸ§® Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
ðŸ”’ Type Safety: Ensures input values and operations are strongly typed using TypeScript.
ðŸ’» Interactive CLI: Powered by Inquirer.js for a user-friendly CLI experience.
ðŸš€ Error Handling: Prevents division by zero and validates user inputs for a seamless experience.
Technologies Used
TypeScript: For type-safe, maintainable, and scalable code.
Node.js: Runtime for executing the application.
Inquirer.js: To build an interactive command-line interface.
