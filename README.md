# TypeScript Calculator CLI Application

This repository contains a **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator Application** built with **TypeScript** and **Inquirer.js**. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) interactively. The application demonstrates the power of TypeScript in building strongly-typed, scalable, and robust applications.

## Features
- ðŸ§® **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- ðŸ”’ **Type Safety**: Ensures input values and operations are strongly typed using TypeScript.
- ðŸ’» **Interactive CLI**: Powered by **Inquirer.js** for a user-friendly CLI experience.
- ðŸš€ **Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero and validates user inputs for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **Node.js**: Runtime for executing the application.
- **Inquirer.js**: To build an interactive command-line interface.
